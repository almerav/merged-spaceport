# Authentication System Implementation

## Summary

This pull request implements a comprehensive authentication system for the Spaceport Backend using NestJS, Passport, and JWT. The implementation includes user authentication endpoints, authentication strategies, and guards to secure the API.

## Changes

- Created authentication module with JWT and local passport strategies
- Implemented login endpoint for user authentication
- Added JWT-based authentication guard for protected routes
- Added status endpoint to verify user authentication
- Enhanced database configuration with environment-specific settings
- Improved application bootstrap process with graceful shutdown handling
- Added database event subscribers for monitoring

## Technical Details

- Authentication is implemented using the `@nestjs/passport` and `passport-jwt` libraries
- JWT tokens are generated upon successful authentication and expire after 1 hour
- Database configuration is now environment-aware with proper validation of required environment variables
- Added logging for authentication processes to facilitate debugging
- Local strategy handles username/password validation
- JWT strategy verifies token authenticity for protected routes

## Testing

- Manual testing performed for login endpoint
- Authentication flow verified with JWT token validation
- Status endpoint confirmed to properly reflect authenticated user information

## Next Steps

- Replace hardcoded JWT secret with environment variable
- Implement refresh token functionality
- Connect authentication to real user database instead of in-memory user data
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for authentication flows
